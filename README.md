This is a repository of my book files for GURPS Character Assistant 5. 

	Official: Books for official supplements which are probably of interest to most GURPS afficionados.
	QoL: Things that for example make the character sheet easier to organize by tagging skills for useful grouping.
	House rules: Books that may or may not be useful for your table, like separating Will and Per from IQ.
	Campaigns: Books for campaigns I participate in. Probably not very interesting for people not at my table.

Some are finished and several are works in progress but the content in all of them should be functional and safe to use even if they are incomplete.
